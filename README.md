Assuming that the final user will be a job recruiter, I aim to display all my information on one page, in a way that is easy and concise to read.
I've chosen to use a dark background in contrast to light-colored letters to imitate dark mode displays. Assuming that I would apply for a job in the game industry, the dark background reminds us of retro games giving off a nostalgic feeling. In contrast, the light palette of colours used for the letters intends to add a joyful and welcoming vibe.
Regarding the typography, I've chosen to use Courier's New's monospace font, as it helps with the retro vibe mentioned before, and is also very easy and pleasant to read.
Finally, I've divided my resume into two parts: the top part shows basic information such as contact info, languages and a little bit of who I am with some interests; the lower part shows my education and my work experience along with extra titles that could be helpful depending on the job. I've displayed the info in a way that is easy to read either on a small desktop or on a bigger desktop.
